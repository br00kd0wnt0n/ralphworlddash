    "Nobody was ever truly convinced by a deck. Decks get polite nods. Decks get \u201C... love it, let\u2019s circle back.\u201D Decks sit in inboxes and hope that something resonates.",
    "You know what gets a reaction? A working thing. Something you can click on, poke at, share with colleagues and question. Something that exists in the world rather than on a slide with a stock photo and a generic line about \u201Cleveraging synergies.\u201D The conversation changes completely when everyone in the room is responding to something real rather than imagining something hypothetical. This applies to pitches, obviously. But it also applies to proactive experiments, internal tools, and client relationship building. In every scenario, the built thing does the talking better than any deck ever could.",
    "I\u2019m Head of Innovation at Ralph, an independent creative social agency with about 100 people across LA, New York, London, and Tokyo. My job is essentially to look out the window for a minute, contemplate my existence and the state of the world, and then get on and build something. Anything. Ideate and execute. As long as it\u2019s interesting, fun or useful. It usually ties together something expected with something new. It\u2019s an awesome job. But it only works because the culture supports it.",
    "Most agencies, especially network shops, won\u2019t let you go anywhere near a sketch or line of code without a brief, a budget, and three rounds of approval. The idea dies in process before it ever becomes anything. Ralph works differently. As our founder Chris Hassell puts it: \u201CI\u2019d rather see something rough that exists than a polished theory. Show me a weird prototype at 3am and then we\u2019ll figure out what it is.\u201D",
    "That\u2019s not a throwaway line. It\u2019s genuinely how the place operates. I\u2019m blessed with the freedom to explore ideas without pre-approval, pressure-test them with the wider team, and then iterate, knowing that when something lands, we will put it to work. Our strategic filter is Gareth Jones, our Head of Growth. When a prototype shows up, Gareth knows who to point it at: \u201CHalf the time, a client doesn\u2019t know they need something until you put it in front of them. A working demo opens conversations that a capabilities deck never would.\u201D",
    "I don\u2019t spend a lot of time surveying the industry for \u201Cwho\u2019s doing AI well.\u201D Mostly because I suspect the answer is still \u201Cnot many.\u201D But there are a couple of operations that have genuinely figured out the model, and they\u2019re worth paying attention to.",
    "Publicis Le Truc / Le Tech is essentially a special ops unit embedded across the group. They\u2019re prototyping for live pitches daily, building tools and proofs of concept that feed directly into business across the network. This isn\u2019t a lab that publishes white papers and waits for applause. It\u2019s a team that ships. The fact that they\u2019ve carved out this kind of build-first culture inside a holding company structure is genuinely impressive, because that environment is typically designed to prevent exactly this kind of speed.",
    "Winston is an AI-centered production shop now in its second year of transparently using the latest AI tools to reduce cost and boost efficiency in asset production for clients. The key word is transparently. No hiding the process, no pretending everything is handcrafted. Clients know exactly what\u2019s AI-assisted and what isn\u2019t, and they keep coming back because the work is better and faster. That honesty is a business model in itself.",
    "At Ralph, rapid prototyping isn\u2019t a side project or an innovation lab exercise. It\u2019s how we operate.",
    "In pitches, we build functional tools during the pitch process itself. When we were going after a Care Bears campaign engagement, we didn\u2019t just present a strategy. We built a growth forecasting dashboard that actually worked. Real data, real projections, real interactivity. That prototype contributed to winning significant business. Like I said, the best pitch is a working thing.",
    "Beyond that, we use prototyping to proactively expand client relationships. Showing up to an existing client with a working solution to a problem they haven\u2019t formally raised changes the entire dynamic. You stop being a vendor responding to briefs and start being a partner who\u2019s thinking ahead. That shift is hard to achieve with a deck. It\u2019s more than theatre when you put a working thing in someone\u2019s hands.",
    "Internally, our custom tools like Narrativ (a storytelling intelligence platform), Voices (our synthetic audience panels), and even throwaway interactive game formats \u2014 all started as \u201Cwhat if?\u201D experiments. Built first, positioned after. Some became client-facing products. Some became internal infrastructure. The point is they existed before anyone asked for them. And there\u2019s a compound effect. Each prototype builds on the last. Narrativ feeds into how we approach client strategy. Voices helps us validate our concepts. Our bespoke dashboards provide measurement in the real world. Nothing exists in isolation. The infrastructure gets smarter and more connected over time.",
    "\u201CBut what about gut feel?\u201D",
    "This is the concern that comes up most, especially from CMOs who want their teams and partners to keep a human hand on their IP. And it\u2019s valid. Nobody wants to hear that a machine is replacing years of craft and earned expertise. But beware: gut feel operating without data in 2026, is risky. Competitors will readily show their workings and their receipts. So let\u2019s move away from guessing with confidence. The signals are too numerous, the cultural shifts too rapid, for instinct alone to catch everything.",
    "Our tools are designed as amplifiers, not replacements. It\u2019s undeniable that knowing which trends and stories are already resonating gives your creative instinct better raw material to work with. The human layer isn\u2019t an afterthought. It\u2019s the entire point. Here\u2019s the great thing about independent shops. No committees. No approval cycles. The distance between curiosity and a working prototype can be the length of a call. That might sound reductive, but an approach to quick realization accelerates output over time into a genuinely different offering, not just a different process.",
    "I believe that the agencies thriving in two years won\u2019t be the ones with the best AI strategy decks. They\u2019ll be the ones that built things today. Not because a client asked or because a brief demanded it. Because someone was curious, had the freedom (and tools) to explore, and had leadership that said \u201Cshow me what you\u2019ve got\u201D instead of \u201Csend me a proposal first.\u201D",
